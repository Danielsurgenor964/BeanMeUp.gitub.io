            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 2022 in the heart of Derry, <strong>Bean Me Up</strong> was born from a love of adventure,
                caffeine,
                and community. We wanted to create more than just a coffee shop a cozy space where people can
                recharge, create, and connect. Whether you are dropping in for your morning espresso or spending hours with your
                laptop and a flat white, you are part of our interstellar family.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
    
                Our mission is simple: to <em>beam you up</em> with every cup. We believe coffee should be an experience one that
                lifts your spirits, fuels your day, and leaves a smile on your face. We are committed to fair
                sourcing, sustainable practices, and making every brew out of this world.
            </p>

            <h2>Meet the Crew</h2>
            <p>
                Behind the counter, you will find our friendly team of baristas passionate about craft coffee and
                dedicated
                to brightening your day. From the perfect pour-over to a caramel latte, every cup is made with care,
                precision, and a dash of stardust.
